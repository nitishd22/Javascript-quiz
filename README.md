## Challenge 4: JavaScript Code Quiz

The objective of this challenge is to create a timed quiz that is scored based off speed and accuracy. The score should be able to be saved to a leaderboard page.

The quiz has 5 questions and 75 seconds. The final score is how many seconds they have left remaining; 10 seconds are taken off additionally if an answer is wrong.

I used html, css, and js files to create this.
